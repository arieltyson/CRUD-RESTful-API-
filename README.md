## Skills Demonstrated 👨🏿‍💻

This project provided a basis for understanding the CRUD operations of a RESTful API. The following skills were demonstrated:

- **CREATE**: A create operation adds a new database record.

- **READ**: A read operation retrieves records from a database based on search criteria.

- **UPDATE**: An update operation changes existing records in a database.

- **DELETE**: A delete operation removes one or more records from the database.

## Project Description 📽️

THe following project is a continuation along the journey of my Java development career. In this leg of the race,
I implement the use of a backend framework, Springboot, to create a RESTful API. This allows me to connect to a database
and thus create a full stack application. The project also dives into API testing through the use of Postman.
